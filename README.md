# Iris-Segmentation-Models
This repository contains the implementation code for iris segmentation models presented in our paper, 'A Comprehensive Evaluation of Iris Segmentation on Benchmarking Datasets. Updates will be added soon, and the current branch contains the initial code upload. For manually annotated iris masks, trained models, and the iris segmentation toolkit (GUI), please contact the author at sumima@clarkson.edu.
